This is the [final paper](https://dhaystead.github.io/pdfs/CLTviaMomentsFinal.pdf) for a DRP I did. It is a nonstandard proof of the central limit theorem by moments. There are other proofs of the CLT using moments but I haven't seen one that doesn't presuppose the existence of higher moments; however, we do not assume their existence. As result, we have to use some additional 'heavy' machinery (namely, the [Denjoy-Carleman Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-analytic_function#The_Denjoy%E2%80%93Carleman_theorem)). How it all gets weaved together for the main proof is pretty cool (I think).
