This is the [final paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/CLTviaMomentsFinal.pdf) for a DRP I did. It is a nonstandard proof of the central limit theorem which uses various tools from the classical moment problem (most notably, the Denjoy-Carleman theorem) to prove the full central limit theorem, i.e., it doesn't assume existence of higher moments.
