I"„<p>This is the <a href="https://dhaystead.github.io/pdfs/CLTviaMomentsFinal.pdf">final paper</a> for a DRP I did. It is a nonstandard proof of the central limit theorem by moments. There are other proofs of the CLT using moments but I havenâ€™t seen one that doesnâ€™t presuppose the existence of higher moments; however, we do not assume their existence. As result, we have to use some additional â€˜heavyâ€™ machinery (namely, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-analytic_function#The_Denjoy%E2%80%93Carleman_theorem">Denjoy-Carleman Theorem</a>). How it all gets weaved together for the main proof is pretty cool (I think).</p>
